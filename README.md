# Getting Started

Copy the entire project's folder into the `Templates` folder of your Unreal Engine installation. If you installed Unreal Engine from the Epic Games Launcher, the `Templates` folder will be located at:

`C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_[version]\Templates` on Windows

`/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_[version]/Templates` on Mac

If you compiled Unreal Engine from source, the `Templates` folder will be located at `[ForkLocation]\UE4\Templates`.

# End Result

You should see the template in the `New Project` dialog like below:
